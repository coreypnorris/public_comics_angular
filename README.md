This is a practice app I built while following the [CodeSchool Angular.js tutorial](http://campus.codeschool.com/courses/shaping-up-with-angular-js)

To run this app on your own:
* clone the repo
* Navigate to the app directory of the repo in your terminal
* Start a simple server by running the `python -mSimpleHTTPServer` command in your terminal
* Navigate to http://localhost:8000/index.html in a browser
